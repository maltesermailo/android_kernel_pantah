# How do I submit patches to Android Common Kernels

1. BEST: Make all of your changes to upstream Linux. If appropriate, backport to the stable releases.
   These patches will be merged automatically in the corresponding common kernels. If the patch is already
   in upstream Linux, post a backport of the patch that conforms to the patch requirements below.

2. LESS GOOD: Develop your patches out-of-tree (from an upstream Linux point-of-view). Unless these are
   fixing an Android-specific bug, these are very unlikely to be accepted unless they have been
   coordinated with kernel-team@android.com. If you want to proceed, post a patch that conforms to the
   patch requrements below.

# Common Kernel patch requirements

- All patches must conform to the Linux kernel coding standards and pass `script/checkpatch.pl`
- All patches must not break gki_defconfig or allmodconfig builds for arm, arm64, x86, x86_64 architectures
- If the patch is not merged from an upstream branch, the headline must be tagged with the type of patch:
UPSTREAM, BACKPORT, FROMGIT, FROMLIST, or ANDROID.
- All patches must have a "Change-Id: " tag (see https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/user-changeid.html)
- If an Android bug has been assigned, there must be a "Bug: XXXX" tag.
- All patches must have a "Signed-off-by:" tag by the author and the submitter

Additional requirements are listed below based on patch type

## Requirements for backports from mainline Linux: UPSTREAM, BACKPORT

- If the patch is a cherry-pick from Linux mainline with no changes at all
	- tag the patch headline with "UPSTREAM: ". 
	- add upstream commit information with an "upstream commit" line

```
	Example:
	
	UPSTREAM: important patch from upstream
	    
	upstream commit 1234567890ab ("important patch from upstream")
	
	This is the detailed description of the important patch
	
	Bug: 135791357
	Change-Id: I4caaaa566ea080fa148c5e768bb1a0b6f7201c01
	Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@foo.org>
```

- If the patch requires any changes from the upstream version, tag the patch with "BACKPORT: ".
	- use the same tags as "UPSTREAM: "

## Requirements for other backports: FROMGIT, FROMLIST,

- If the patch has been merged into an upstream maintainer tree, but has not yet
been merged into Linux mainline
	- tag the patch headline with "FROMGIT: "
	- add info on where the patch came from as "(cherry picked from commit <sha1> <repo> <branch>)"
	- if changes were required, use "BACKPORT: FROMGIT:"

```
	Example:
	
	 FROMGIT: important patch from upstream
	
	 This is the detailed description of the important patch
	
	 Bug: 135791357
	 (cherry picked from commit 878a2fd9de10b03d11d2f622250285c7e63deace
	  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/foo/bar.git test-branch)
	 Change-Id: I4caaaa566ea080fa148c5e768bb1a0b6f7201c01
	 Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@foo.org>
```


- If the patch has been submitted to LKML, but not accepted into any maintainer tree
	- tag the patch headline with "FROMLIST: "
	- add a "List: " tag with a link to the submittal
	- if changes were required, use "BACKPORT: FROMLIST:"
```
	Example:
	
	FROMLIST: important patch from upstream
	
	This is the detailed description of the important patch
	
	Bug: 135791357
	Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/5/1/6900
	Change-Id: I4caaaa566ea080fa148c5e768bb1a0b6f7201c01
	Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@foo.org>
```

## Requirements for Android-specific patches: ANDROID

- If the patch is fixing a bug to Android-specific code
	- tag the patch headline with "ANDROID: "
	- add a "Fixes: " tag that cites the patch with the bug

- If the patch is a new feature
	- tag the patch headline with "ANDROID: "
	- add a "Bug: " tag with the Android bug (required for android-specific features)
